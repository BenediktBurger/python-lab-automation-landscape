# Python lab automation landscape catalog

This page should serve as a catalog of Python packages for laboratory automation, meaning data acquisition and control of hardware instruments during experiments, e.g. in a company or university lab.

It originated from a [thread](https://github.com/LabPy/labpy-discussion/issues/23) that I (Christoph Buchner, @bilderbuchi) started in an effort to make sense of the many options available for this task, and to obtain some structured analysis to make it easier for others to choose the package(s) most appropriate for their needs.

This grew from a bullet-point list into a discussion thread and then an [online spreadsheet](https://ethercalc.net/1anmq248ktu6) hosted with a free provider, where others started to contribute details about packages. Sometimes they left their Github handles so it was possible to attribute their contributions.

Over time this became more fragile, impossible to version, and hard to get the desired overview from. This is why I have now turned this into this webpage.

Issues/pull requests with additional/updated information will be welcome, but this is still very much a work in progress to get "finished".

The table detailing the shape of the Python lab automation landscape can be found in the [Catalog]({% link table_page.md %}).
