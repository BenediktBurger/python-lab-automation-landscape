This is a low-activity project, and your help is welcome.

If you want to **add another project**, we need a new YAML file like [this one](https://github.com/pymeasure/python-lab-automation-landscape/blob/gh-pages/_data/projects/test%20framework.yml), with as many fields as you manage filled out, and placed in the `_data/projects` folder.
Ideally, you can fork the project, and provide the file via a Pull Request.  
If that is too much friction, you can alternatively [open an issue](https://github.com/pymeasure/python-lab-automation-landscape/issues) with the prepared contents of the YAML file in a [code section](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#quoting-code), and I can do the rest.

If you want to help otherwise, take a look at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pymeasure/python-lab-automation-landscape/issues)! Thanks!
